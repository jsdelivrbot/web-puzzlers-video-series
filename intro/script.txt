Welcome!

[FWD]
In this video series, I'm going to present some puzzles.

[FWD]
All of these relate to JavaScript and web security.

For each puzzle, you'll find a link in the video notes to code that you can play around with in your browser.
Each puzzle defines one public function that takes a string.
Your goal is to find a string input that violates some security assumption.

[FWD]
My goal isn't to teach developers how to identify bugs that leave their users' vulnerable.

I want to identify ways to produce secure systems even when there are bugs.

[FWD]
Security is a team effort.  I work on Google's security engineering team.
We work to reduce the burden on developers by improving tools, libraries, and programming languages.

I've worked on JavaScript tools like compilers, linters, template languages, and sandboxes.
And on the security implications of language design decisions in JavaScript --
finding the bad parts that don't make it into Doug Crockford's book.

[FWD]
After the puzzles, there's another video that will talk about the problems underlying these puzzles,
and how to get security even when developers make common mistakes.

I'll then get into some specific language level proposals that I think will help security specialists and developers work together efficiently.

[FWD]
Thanks for watching!  And enjoy the puzzles.
